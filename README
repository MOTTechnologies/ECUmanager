To install ECUmanager in a x86 debian/ubuntu box, use the deb package available in the Downloads section.

ECUmanager uses Qt4, so you need to have installed libqt4-dev in order to compile it under gnu/linux.

apt-get install libqt4-dev

If you use QtCreator, just open qt4application.pro, and enjoy.
To give it a try:
apt-get install qtcreator

For a command line compiling, you are a "make" away.

For windows users, install Qt Creator and open qt4application.pro with it. Then, build it.

In both cases, make some coffe, or take a shower... it will be compiling for a while the first time (2-5 min).
Tip: Parallelize the compilation through N threads using "make -jN" ;-)

/DataExamples/Fiat Palio FIRE lean.txt is the config file I use in my car. Try it (File->Open)
