To install ECUmanager in a x86 debian/ubuntu box:
aptitude install libqt4-gui qwtplot3d-qt4-0
install libqextserialport and ecumanager (check download section!: github.com/nitrousnrg/ECUmanager/archives/master)

ECUmanager uses Qt4, so you need to resolve more dependencies to compile it under gnu/linux.

apt-get install libqt4-dev libqwtplot3d-qt4-dev
and libqextserialport-dev (also in downloads section)

compile with:
qmake-qt4 qt4application.pro -spec linux-g++ -r && make

If you use QtCreator, just open qt4application.pro.
To give it a try:
apt-get install qtcreator

For Windows users:
install Qt Creator and open qt4application.pro with it. Then, build it.

It will compile if you provide the qwtplot3d and qextserialport dll

/DataExamples/Fiat Palio FIRE lean.cfg is the config file I use in my car. Try it (File->Open)
