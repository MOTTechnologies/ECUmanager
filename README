ECUmanager uses Qt4, so you need to have installed libqt4-dev in order to compile it under gnu/linux.

apt-get install qt4-qmake
apt-get install libqt4-dev

If you use QtCreator, just open qt4application.pro, and enjoy.
To give it a try:
apt-get install qtcreator

For a command line compiling, you are a "make" away.

For windows users, install Qt Creator, but it won't compile, the 3D map isn't portable -yet-

In both cases, make some coffe, or take a shower... it needs some time to compile the first time -between one and five min-.

/DataExamples/Fiat Palio FIRE lean.txt is the config file I use in my car. Try it (File->Open)
